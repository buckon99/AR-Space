# As an online shopper, I want to know how much space something takes up, so that
I know the product will fit before I buy it
  
# As a busy person, I want to know if a product I am looking at is the right size,
so that I know its the right size before buying it or having to measure out the size

# As a spatially challenged person, I want to use my phone to see the size of things,
so that I can easily tell if something fits where I want it
